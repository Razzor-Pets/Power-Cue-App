# Power-Cue-App
They say software engineers are built like a twig. Yes, they are and so am I, that's why i built this exercise app for myself. Oh, don't misunderstand i don't want muscles to impress women, it's so that i can carry groceries my mom tells me to carry, but easier. Check README for more information. Let me see you again with musclesðŸ’ª bye, byeðŸ‘‹.
